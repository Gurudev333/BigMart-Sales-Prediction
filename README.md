# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
It is type of regression problem whcih can be tried to solve using two approaches </br>
1.XGBoost with hypertunning.</br>
2.Random forest with hypertunning.</br>
This two algorithms had their own importance and uses.The xgboost is used in many competitions.</br>
Here hypertuning is performed with GreadySearch which intially takes some intial parameter values</br>
then it will search for parameter values which increases the accuracy of model.So some details about problems are</br>
•The goal is to find item sale at Outlet of different types & located at different locations.</br>
•It includes task such as data visualization, cleaning and transformation,feature engineering.</br>
•Python is used as programming language and Jupyter Notebook is used as tools.</br>
•packages used are</br>
1.pandas.</br>
2.numpy.</br>
3.sklearn.</br>
4.matplotlib.</br>
